sometimes a little cheeky slipup can lead to some dire consequences for some people (cough vewu), so I made this tool to help you find any other repos that have your name or email in the git commit history


## Documentation

```--github-repository``` - A Link to the github repo
```--target-email``` - The email the program should search for
```--target-name``` - The name the program should search for
```--target-branch``` = The branch of the repo that the tool should be searching in

> **Warning** THESE ARE NON OPTIONAL
